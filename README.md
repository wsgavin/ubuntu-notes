# Ubuntu Notes

I created this git repository to jot down notes about installing and configuring Ubuntu desktop. Purely for personal reasons.

## Updates & Installs

The following will update Ubuntu with the lasted of the currently installed applications as well as install a few I like to have on my base system. Each application is called separately for documentation purposes (easier to read).

    $ ./setup.sh
